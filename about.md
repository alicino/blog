👋 Hello! I'm **Alicino Moura**, a cybersecurity professional, cloud networking enthusiast, and web technology expert. I specialize in designing resilient and high-performance infrastructures, with a solid foundation in network security, Cloudflare technologies, project management, data science, and Python development.

### 🚀 Background & Skills

Throughout my career, I’ve worked extensively with cybersecurity and enterprise networking, helping organizations build secure, scalable, and fast digital environments. My areas of expertise include:

- Threat analysis and mitigation  
- Network segmentation and Zero Trust models  
- Cloudflare security and performance solutions  
- Data visualization, BI, and analytics  
- Automation with Python and scripting

My professional journey has been diverse: I started in aviation, working with fuels like Jet-A1 and Avgas. Later, I led infrastructure projects for a major bank in Brazil and also worked as a database administrator — a role that naturally led me into business intelligence and data science.

I’m mostly self-taught in programming. My journey began with Shell Script, fueled by my passion for Linux, and evolved into advanced Python programming and data handling.

### 🧪 Homelab & Networking

Outside of work, I’m an avid homelabber. I manage a full Proxmox cluster, Raspberry Pi nodes, segmented VLANs, and TrueNAS storage setups. This blog reflects my hands-on experiments and insights on:

- Home networking  
- Containerization & virtualization  
- DNS, firewalls, and automation

If you're passionate about self-hosting, homelab architecture, or network engineering, you'll feel right at home here.

### 🏃 Sports & Hobbies

I’m also an endurance athlete and podcast host. My show, **Tô na Correria**, shares running experiences, training tips, and endurance insights (Portuguese only). You can track my runs and training on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/19091518).

Since I was 13, painting has been a meaningful hobby — mostly oil on canvas. I've created over 50 paintings so far. Although it's harder to keep up with this passion today, I always try to bring it back into my routine.

My love for creation started even earlier, in a car workshop, working on bodywork. That experience drove me to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on automotive design. My graduation project was a formula-style race car, built by a team of six engineering students:

### 🌐 Language Learning & Reading

I’m passionate about languages and continuous learning. I speak Portuguese natively, am fluent in English, and currently study Japanese and Spanish. I also love reading — particularly books about technology, cybersecurity, and personal growth.

### 📚 What You’ll Find on This Blog

This blog is a space where I share guides, hands-on tutorials, and real-world lessons on:

- Cybersecurity 
- Networking and homelab setups  
- Cloudflare solutions  
- Python, automation, and data science

My goal is to help both beginners and experienced professionals make sense of today's complex digital landscape through **clear, practical content**.
