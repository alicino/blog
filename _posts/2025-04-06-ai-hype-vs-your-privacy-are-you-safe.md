Nowadays, everyone is talking about AI (Artificial Intelligence). Companies, professionals, and people from all backgrounds are embracing this technological evolution. And honestly, who can blame them? AI is incredibly handy — it helps with tasks, explains complex topics, supports our studies, and gives advice on almost anything.

But here's the thing: in all this excitement, people often forget they're sharing sensitive data with these tools.

### Should You Be Worried? Here's Why You Might.

Let me explain if you don't understand. When talking with a generative AI, you usually mention or send sensitive data about you or your life. Sometimes, professionals copy/paste code, IPs, URLs, hashes, or other secrets in the prompt. The AI collects this data and keeps it there to "build your profile."

The truth is, you **don’t really know** what happens to your data:

- **You don't know** what the AI is doing with your data. Period.
- **You don't know** who has access to your data. Period.
- **You don't know** how long your data will be stored. Period.
- **You don't know** if your data will be used for other purposes. Period.
- **You don't know** if your data will be shared with third parties. Period.
- **You don't know** if your data will be used to train other AI models. Period
- **You don't know** if your data will be used to create new AI models. Period
- **You don't know** if your data will be used to create new AI models that will be used to harm you. Period
... and many more questions.

Would you like to know what the AI knows about you?
If you use ChatGPT (for example), open a new prompt and write something similar to it:

  > Based on the history of our conversations, what do you know about me?

You will see that the AI has a lot of information about you.
(Note: This might not work if memory is disabled.)

### How to Reduce AI Memory and Data Use (ChatGPT Example)

1. **Open Settings**  
   Click your profile picture (top right) > **Settings**

2. **Go to the “Personalization” Tab**  
   - Under **Custom Instructions**, you can review or clear what you’ve shared  
   - Under **Memory**, click **Manage memory** to see what’s saved. You can delete specific items or all at once.

3. **Go to the “Data Controls” Tab**  
   - Turn off **Improve the model for everyone**  
   - In **Voice mode**, disable:
     - Include audio recordings  
     - Include video recordings
